At our first meeting, we all already knew roughly what the framework of the project was. That's why we were all able to come up with good ideas right away. Funnily enough, many of our ideas were in a supermarket. Maybe we all like shopping so much or maybe we have a passion for optimizing the shopping process and the customer experience. However, the ideas in the supermarket have remained and become more and more specific.

As a general guideline we used the well known business model canvas. Project Overview In the scope of our group project for the lecture Artificial Intelligence in Service Systems - Computer Vision, we were concerned with the question, how we can improve the shopping experience in supermarkets in Germany. A consensus was quickly found, as we all agreed that the worst thing at shopping trips is waiting in long lines for an extended amount of time. Often, the reason for this is that a customer forgot to correctly label or weigh an item that he wants to buy, and the cashier has to correct that mistake by either having the correct label memorized or looking it up in a long list of labels for each product. As even this simple thought experiment showed how error-prone the payment-process in German supermarkets is, we wanted our approach to tackle this exact problem. The constraints that we imposed on ourselves were, that our solution had to be small and minimal invasive to the current processes, enabling an easy and cheap implementation for the supermarkets. One solution that satisfies all hardware constraints is the use of a Jetson Nano from Nvidia, as these devices are small, relatively cheap and still powerful. Furthermore, an approach that utilizes computer vision seemed well suited for this scenario, as we can use a camera with the Jetson Nano in way that requires minimal changes from the cash register setup. Our idea is now to incorporate methods from machine learning, namely computer vision, into this process to allow a quick detection of the specific items, which then can automatically be transferred into the cashier system. In order to accomplish this, a camera needs to be mounted over the cash register in a small device to run an object detection algorithm on each frame. A general prototype of the interface of our solution can be seen in the following figure. ???Bild vom Interface??? As the device has to be cheap, small, but powerful enough to run such a complex task, our device of choice was the Jetson Nano. In order to flesh out our idea, we created a business plan using the business canvas model. As model we used a one-stage convolutional neural network, namely with the specific network structure YOLO. Further details are described in the later sections. How do we sell this Project?

But what does that actually mean? That means that we don't want to take a finished bifurcated dataset and this is not the goal of our project, but we generate a whole large dataset from a few cropped images of the objects. You can find a more detailed description here. Why synthetic Data Generating data instead of collecting it has various advantages, but is not applicable in every case. For example, if you want to operate in an area where you never know exactly which objects should be detected, then the whole thing is not an idea because the variance compared to real data is missing. But in a supermarket you can assume that for example a cucumber looks like a cucumber, and this is even standardized. Due to these conditions it is possible to adapt a new data set to the current assortment in a short time.
